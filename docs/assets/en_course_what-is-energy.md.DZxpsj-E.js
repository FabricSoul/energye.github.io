It leverages the Webkit engine and takes advantage of HTML5 features implemented in Chrome, and in terms of performance, it also closely resembles Chrome. Custom plugins, custom protocols, custom JavaScript objects and extensions, and controlled operations like resource loading, navigation, context menus, response filtering, cookie management, and more are also feasible. LCL (Lazarus Component Library) provides native system UI widgets and facilitates cross-platform development. By combining LCL with CEF, applications with diverse interfaces can be created.</p></blockquote><h3 id="welcome-to-join" tabindex="-1">Welcome to join <a class="header-anchor" href="#welcome-to-join" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Welcome to join&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The development of Energy is still underway, and there are many tasks that cannot be accomplished alone.
